API 

frontend --> kicks off data request --> backend --> taks to the DB --> gets info from it --> returns back to the frontend 

APIs are really just a way to get data from a database 

- 1. we don't want direct access to a database because of sensitive data
- 2. connections to a database are very sensitive
- 3. backends are middlemen for frontend and DB

Types of db
MongoDB 
PostgreSQL
